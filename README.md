Fizz Buzz implementation with Keras.io 

A few weeks ago I read the funny blog post of Joel Grus http://joelgrus.com/2016/05/23/fizz-buzz-in-tensorflow/ about an interview and the fizz buzz test

As I use keras for my machine learning projects , I made an implementation based on keras.io deep learning library 

I get 92% accuracy : not that bad ;)

I finally manage to get 100% using the SReLU activation layer from Keras
